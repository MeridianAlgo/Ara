**User Story:** As a trader, I want multi-timeframe analysis that combines predictions across different time horizons, so that I can make more informed decisions considering both short-term and long-term trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing stocks THEN the system SHALL generate predictions for 1-day, 3-day, 5-day, and 10-day horizons
2. WHEN combining timeframes THEN the system SHALL weight predictions based on historical accuracy for each horizon
3. WHEN timeframes disagree THEN the system SHALL highlight potential trend reversals or continuation patterns
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show prediction consistency across different time horizons
5. IF short-term and long-term predictions conflict THEN the system SHALL provide analysis of potential causes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want online learning capabilities that continuously update models with new data, so that predictions remain accurate as market conditions evolve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new market data arrives THEN the system SHALL incrementally update model weights without full retraining
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger model updates or retraining
3. WHEN updating models THEN the system SHALL maintain prediction accuracy while adapting to new patterns
4. WHEN concept drift is detected THEN the system SHALL adjust learning rates and model parameters accordingly
5. IF online learning fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to periodic batch retraining

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want advanced regularization techniques and overfitting prevention, so that models generalize better to unseen market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL implement dropout, batch normalization, and weight decay
2. WHEN detecting overfitting THEN the system SHALL use early stopping with validation loss monitoring

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing market data THEN the system SHALL classify current market regime using statistical and ML methods
2. WHEN regime changes THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to regime-specific models or parameters
3. WHEN in high volatility periods THEN the system SHALL increase uncertainty estimates and adjust position sizing recommendations
