# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a machine learning stock analysis and price prediction platform that combines PyTorch for deep learning, Node.js for API services, and Python for data processing. The platform will analyze single-day stock price data, train predictive models using technical indicators, and forecast next-day prices through a terminal-based interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to input a stock symbol and analyze its price data, so that I can get predictions for the next trading day.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a stock symbol THEN the system SHALL fetch current day price data from a financial API
2. WHEN price data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL calculate technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands)
3. WHEN technical indicators are calculated THEN the system SHALL display the analysis results in the terminal
4. IF the stock symbol is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prompt for a valid symbol

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the system to automatically train a neural network model, so that it can learn from historical patterns and technical indicators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN price data and indicators are available THEN the system SHALL prepare training data with features and labels
2. WHEN training data is prepared THEN the system SHALL initialize a PyTorch neural network model
3. WHEN the model is initialized THEN the system SHALL train the model using the current session's data
4. WHEN training is complete THEN the system SHALL save the trained model weights for future use
5. IF training fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with a default model

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to receive next-day price predictions with confidence metrics, so that I can make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trained model is available THEN the system SHALL generate price predictions for the next trading day
2. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL calculate confidence intervals and probability scores
3. WHEN predictions are ready THEN the system SHALL display predicted price, direction (up/down), and confidence level
4. WHEN displaying predictions THEN the system SHALL include risk warnings about prediction accuracy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to run entirely from the terminal with clear commands, so that it can be easily integrated into automated trading workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL provide a command-line interface with available options
2. WHEN a user enters commands THEN the system SHALL validate input and provide immediate feedback
3. WHEN processing occurs THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress indicators
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL return to the command prompt for next action
5. IF invalid commands are entered THEN the system SHALL display help information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to handle data persistence and model management, so that predictions improve over time with accumulated data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new data is processed THEN the system SHALL store it in a local database
2. WHEN models are trained THEN the system SHALL version and save model checkpoints
3. WHEN the system restarts THEN it SHALL load the most recent model weights
4. WHEN historical data exists THEN the system SHALL use it to enhance training datasets
5. IF storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL continue operation with in-memory data only

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to provide real-time market data integration, so that predictions are based on the most current information available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to financial data APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or similar)
2. WHEN requesting data THEN the system SHALL handle API rate limits and retry logic
3. WHEN market data is received THEN the system SHALL validate data quality and completeness
4. WHEN data is invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL use fallback data sources or cached data
5. IF all data sources fail THEN the system SHALL notify the user and suggest manual data input

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want the system to support multiple technical analysis indicators, so that the model can learn from diverse market signals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing price data THEN the system SHALL calculate at least 8 technical indicators
2. WHEN indicators are calculated THEN the system SHALL include trend, momentum, volatility, and volume-based metrics
3. WHEN preparing model features THEN the system SHALL normalize indicator values for neural network input
4. WHEN indicators cannot be calculated THEN the system SHALL use default values or skip incomplete indicators
5. IF indicator calculation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with available indicators

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see comprehensive performance metrics and error rates, so that I can assess the reliability and accuracy of the predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL calculate and display prediction error rates (MAE, MSE, RMSE)
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show directional accuracy percentage (correct up/down predictions)
3. WHEN model training completes THEN the system SHALL display training loss, validation loss, and convergence metrics
4. WHEN historical predictions exist THEN the system SHALL calculate rolling accuracy over different time windows (1-day, 7-day, 30-day)
5. WHEN showing performance THEN the system SHALL include profit/loss simulation based on prediction accuracy
6. IF insufficient historical data exists THEN the system SHALL display limited metrics with data availability warnings

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want detailed model diagnostics and feature importance analysis, so that I can understand what drives the predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL display feature importance scores for all input indicators
2. WHEN showing diagnostics THEN the system SHALL include model confidence distribution and uncertainty metrics
3. WHEN predictions are made THEN the system SHALL show which technical indicators contributed most to the prediction
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL include prediction stability metrics across multiple model runs
5. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL suggest retraining or parameter adjustments
6. IF model overfitting is detected THEN the system SHALL display overfitting warnings and regularization suggestions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system user, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can track system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed timestamps, operation types, and execution times
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error types, stack traces, and recovery actions taken
3. WHEN displaying logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by log level, component, and time range
4. WHEN system performance is monitored THEN it SHALL track memory usage, CPU utilization, and API response times
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create performance summaries with key metrics and trends
6. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL log warnings and suggest optimization actions
